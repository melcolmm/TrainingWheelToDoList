# TrainingWheelToDoList
ToDoList project in Java

This project is a basic to-do list showing a name, description and due date for a list of to-dos.

Each to-do is sorted by date, and if the to-do due date has passed, the to-do is highlighted in red.

There is a button using the system date and time to show today's to-dos, and another button allowing
users to add new to-dos.
